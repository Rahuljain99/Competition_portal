# Competition_portal

Competition Portal (For an internship test)

Made a competition portal where people would sign up for a promotional competition of a product. and get a point for that. They would also get a mail of a referral link which they can share with other people and both people would get points. It was a limited time competition. The winner would be chosen on the basis of the points. There was a seperate portal for admins where they could see the results. Made with HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
